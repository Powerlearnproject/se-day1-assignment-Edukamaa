#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It's the process of designing, developing, and maintaining software systematically.
It's important in tech because it ensures software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s: First high-level programming languages (like FORTRAN) were developed.
1970s: Introduction of structured programming and software development methodologies.
2000s: Agile development became popular, emphasizing flexibility and customer feedback.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define goals and scope.
Analysis: Gather and analyze requirements.
Design: Create architecture and design of the system.
Implementation: Write and compile code.
Testing: Check for bugs and verify functionality.
Deployment: Release the software to users.
Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Sequential approach. Best for projects with clear, unchanging requirementse.g., building infrastructure.
Agile: Iterative approach. Ideal for projects needing flexibility and frequent updates e.g., web apps


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes code, builds software.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software to find bugs.
Project Manager: Oversees the project, ensures deadlines are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Tools that make coding easier (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ).
VCS: Tracks changes to code, helps manage versions (e.g., Git, SVN). Both are crucial for efficient development and collaboration.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complex Requirements: Break them down into smaller parts.
Tight Deadlines: Prioritize tasks and focus on essentials.
Bug Fixes: Regularly test and review code to catch issues early.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components.
Integration Testing: Tests how components work together.
System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Verifies if the software meets user requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering: It's the process of crafting questions or instructions in a way that gets the best possible response from an AI model.
It's important because the quality of the prompt directly impacts the accuracy and relevance of the AI's output.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.
Vague: "Tell me about world war history."
Improved: "Give me a brief overview of the causes of World War II."
Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 The improved prompt is specific, so the AI knows exactly what information to focus on. Itâ€™s concise, which helps the AI give a more targeted and useful response.
